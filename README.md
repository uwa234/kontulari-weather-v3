# Kontulari Weather: Technical Challenge

Welcome to Brazilian online accounting startup that is coming to the market to be a reference.

Kontulari is growing up and already has active customers! It was created by a large accounting company with more than 12 years in market. We want to impact lives of small companies, supporting them to organize finances and accounting of their business in a quick, practical and complete way. More about us: https://kontulari.com.br

Would you like to be part of this journey and help us build it?

Let's go!

## The Challenge

Let's take a look at the weather forecast? This challenge aims to add some features in **React.js** application, that consumes an API to show the user the weather forecast for some locations.

You must implement these features:

- At least three more information to the WeatherCard.jsx;
- Make the application responsive for at least three screens (smartphone, tablet and notebook);
- Create a light/dark mode (you can use a combinantion of these colors: coral (#FD657E ) blue(#002E46) green (#1DE9B6), white (#fff));
- Add a tip of what to do according to the weather of the day (exemple, if it is sunny you can go to the beach);
- Implement unity test on the main screen;

In addition, you must fix some bugs.

Others features will be welcome. We only will evaluate the front-end, Organization of commits and usability.

## API

Kontulari Weather uses the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api). Visit the website to get your own API key (it's free). Follow these steps:

- Create an account (https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up);
- Open Weather will send an email. Check your email, and click on 'Verify your email';
- On 'My API Keys'(https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) you can find your key;
- Once you have your key, insert in both files: ./src/App.js and ./src/components/SearchBox

The list of locations can be found in ./src/data.js. You are free to increase this list.

Example URL with location (insert your key instead of 'your-key'):

`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=-12.9704&lon=-38.5124&&units=metric&appid=your-key`

#### Require

- Node.js (version 14.17 ou higher)
- Git (version 2.33 or higher)
- Yarn (version 1.22 or higher)

First of all, create a fork form this project, and clone for your local repository.

## Deadline

After receive, you have three days to conclude the challenge. Then, send a Pull Request to this repository link from the fork that was created.

## Attention

**This code is yours**. We will not use any code implemented in this challenge.

_Let's code!_

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
