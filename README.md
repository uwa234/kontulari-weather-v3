## The Challenge

Let's take a look at the weather forecast? This challenge aims to add some features in **React.js** application, that consumes an API to show the user the weather forecast for some locations.

You must implement these features:

- At least three more information to the WeatherCard.jsx;
- Make the application responsive for at least three screens (smartphone, tablet and notebook);
- Create a light/dark mode (you can use a combinantion of these colors: coral (#FD657E ) blue(#002E46) green (#1DE9B6), white (#fff));
- Add a tip of what to do according to the weather of the day (exemple, if it is sunny you can go to the beach);
- Implement unity test on the main screen;

In addition, you must fix some bugs.

Others features will be welcome. We only will evaluate the front-end, Organization of commits and usability.

## API

Kontulari Weather uses the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api). Visit the website to get your own API key (it's free). Follow these steps:

- Once you have your key, insert in both files: ./src/App.js and ./src/components/SearchBox

The list of locations can be found in ./src/data.js. You are free to increase this list.

Example URL with location (insert your key instead of 'your-key'):
